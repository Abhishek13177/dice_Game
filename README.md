Dicee Game

Dicee is a simple web-based dice game where two players "roll" virtual dice to determine a winner. The game refreshes the page to simulate a dice roll, and displays a message indicating whether Player 1 wins, Player 2 wins, or if the game is a draw.
How It Works

    Random Dice Roll: Each time the page is refreshed, the script generates two random numbers between 1 and 6, representing the roll of a dice for each player.
    Dynamic Dice Images: The dice images are updated based on the randomly generated numbers.
    Winner Announcement: The game compares the two numbers and displays a message indicating the winner or if the game is a draw.

Technologies Used

    HTML: For structuring the web page.
    CSS: For styling the page.
    JavaScript: For adding interactivity by generating random dice rolls and updating the page content dynamically.

How to Play

Simply refresh the page to roll the dice and see who wins!
